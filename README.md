# Stonk Tracker

**Introduction**

  After considering a few different ideas, my project will be to make a program that automatically tracks my stock trades in a spreadsheet. Individual platforms offer this, but user’s have to do it manually and it ends up being a pain. Using my program, I will be able to automatically pull all the information I need from different platforms and put it into a single spreadsheet to track.
  This project is going to be fun and helpful in a few different ways. First, I enjoy both of these things. This gives me a nice way to combine the two and make something useful of it. Combining the two of these things is actually what I would like to do for a job one day. This will provide me with an opportunity to make something to showcase that I am knowledgeable with both.
  I will also learn or strengthen my understanding of a few different skills along the way. Python is something that I am not completely comfortable with yet, so a project will be a big step towards getting there. Also, it will allow me to not only get better at using API’s, but it will require a couple of different ones. I will have to be able to make them all work together with my code.
	
**Abstract**

  Many platforms offer solutions to track your stock trades in a spreadsheet, but none are able to make it easy and automated. Using Python, I will be able to automatically pull stock trades from different platforms and put them in a spreadsheet to make tracking them easy. My project will help save time that can be put into other areas.
Research/Project Choice
  I considered a couple of different ideas for this. Ideally for my career, I would like to find a job that lets me combine programming with stocks. I had thought of trying to do some LinkedIn Learning Courses related to this, but I thought that actually building something might be more interesting and look better on a resume. I want to build a program that will automatically track my stock trades and put all of the information into a spreadsheet.
  Most investment platforms will give you an option to export all of your trades into a spreadsheet and you can get it that way. This is still something you have to manually do and if you use multiple platforms, it is a pain. By doing this, it will automate the whole process and I can just refer to the spreadsheet for information. This will not only allow me to build a project that is useful and interesting to me, but it will help me to improve my skills with spreadsheets and using API’s.

**The Plan**

  After researching the different options, I think that Python may be a better choice for this project. I am not as good with it as Java, so it will probably slow me down on some things, but will be more efficient when it comes to others. Between school and baseball, I don’t always have a ton of free time. I want to say I will put 2 hours per week towards this. This will not all be spent just writing code, because I also have to learn new things before I am actually able to put this into code. I will be using GitHub as much as I can so I am able to track my progress and see the progression from week to week. The two hours per week could all be on one day or it could be small chunks each day. Also, I think this is a good starting point for the project and if I am able to complete it in time, I’m sure I will come up with new ideas to implement along the way that I can work on.

**Discussion**

  My main goal is to have a complete working program. I realize that there are many steps along the path to that and I will have to focus on knocking them out one at a time. Some of my other goals are to improve my spreadsheet skills, strengthen my Python knowledge, and become more familiar with using API’s.
  I think that my lack of experience using Python and Google Sheets will slow me down, but it is all part of the learning experience. I also am choosing a somewhat simple idea for now because I think that I will come up with more ideas and features once I dive into it.

**Conclusion**

  By the end of this, I will have a program that can track my stock trades from different platforms and automatically put it into a spreadsheet. This will track my trades, dates, and profit/loss for each one. I chose this because I would like to combine my knowledge of programming with my knowledge of stocks as a career one day. This will be a neat way to combine both of them and will let me pick up on some useful info along the way.
